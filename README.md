# Analyze and Interpret Big Data (15 marks)
We need to learn and understand the data through at least 4 analytical methods
(descriptive statistics, correlation, hypothesis testing, density estimation, etc.). You need to
present your work numerically and graphically. Apply tooltip text, legend, title, X-Y labels etc.
accordingly to help end-users for getting insights.
#. Design and Build a Classifier (35 marks)
## Design and build a binary classifier over the dataset. Explain your algorithm and its
configuration. Explain your findings into both numerical and graphical
representations. Evaluate the performance of the model and verify the accuracy and
the effectiveness of your model. [15 marks]
## Apply a multi-class classifier to classify data into ten classes (categories): one normal
and nine attacks (e.g., Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic,
Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms). Briefly explain your model with supportive
statements on its parameters, accuracy and effectiveness. [20 marks]
Tip: you can use this link (https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/mlclassification-
regression.html) for more information on modelling.
